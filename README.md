# Simple-Linear-Regression
This is probably the dumbest dataset . The whole point is, however, to provide a common dataset for linear regression. Although such a dataset can easily be generated in Excel with random numbers, results would not be comparable.


The training dataset is a CSV file with 700 data pairs (x,y). 

The x-values are numbers between 0 and 100. 

The corresponding y-values have been generated using the Excel function NORMINV(RAND(), x, 3). 

Consequently, the best estimate for y should be x. The test dataset is a CSV file with 300 data pairs.
